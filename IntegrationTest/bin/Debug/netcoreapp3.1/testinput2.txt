A short story about myself
I was born on the 5rd of May 1987 in Kazan. Like many other children when I was a child I went to a kindergarten.

	At the age of 7 I went to school. I was very proud when I became a pupil.

But very soon I realized that I had to work hard if I wanted my parents to be pleased with me.

I am an outgoing person. I like to go to discos, to parties with my friends. Certainly we talk a lot about life, our problems.

	Sometimes I like to stay home alone, I went to school especially when I need some relaxation. Then I listen to music, watch television or read books.

I am a school leaver now. I have good marks. I am going to enter the university. The most important thing now is to pass the entrance exams well and to enter the university.
