It may not “technically” be the summer yet (the first day of summer is June 20th), but school is out so it is summer time in my books!
That means lazy days sipping lemonade on the porch, swimming at the pool or beach, lots of swinging in the backyard, blowing super big bubbles, riding bikes to the Dairy Queen, summer vacation, lots of grilling, late nights looking at the stars or camping at our favorite national park, and so much more!
I always look forward to a slower pace with lots of free time to make memories with my kids and enjoy the warm weather.
I also love gardening, so I love planning, planting, and watching my garden grow. And the older I get, the more I am enjoying growing flowers – enjoying their beauty.
But summer isn’t all relaxing days, kids get bored and are looking for things to do.
And kids need to stay engaged and learning to avoid summer learning loss.
One of my favorite ways to keeps kids engaged and their minds sharps is by continuing to read lots of great books. Here are some must read summer stories for kids.
So cuddle up in your tree house, in a lounge by the pool, under an umbrella at he beach, or in a comfy sofa – we’ve got some great summer books for kids picked out for your family.
These summer books for preschoolers, kindergartners, grade 1, grade 2, and grade 3 students are a great way to keep kids reading, exploring the word, and forming a solid foundation for future success.
